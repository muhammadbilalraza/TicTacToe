# CS391 Project 1
The purpose of our project is to develop and implement a working **Tic-Tac-Toe** web application using HTML, vanilla CSS and Javascript.

Tic-tac-toe is a simple and fun two player game in which the players take turns putting **X's** or **O's** on a 3x3 grid.
The first player to get 3 marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game, and the other loses the game.

To start our web application, there is no need to load or install an additional library.
There is also no need for a specific web browser to play our game as it is optimised for every web browser.
Just open the **index.html** file in any web browser, which will take the person to the signup page.
If you have an existing account, click on signin and enter your credentials.
Otherwise, make a new account and then signin.
By signing in, the game page will automatically open and you can enjoy our game with another friend.
If you are not sure about the rules of the game or how to play it, click on the **how to** button from the navigation bar.
It will take you to the rules of the game. Go through it and enjoy the game!
When you are done enjoying the game with your friend, you can logout from the application by clicking the **logout** button from the navigation bar.
A **feedback form** will open after logging out.
After filling it and giving us some feedback about our game, the submit button will take you back to the signup page.
