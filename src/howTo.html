        Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you
        might do next.
      </p>
      <h2><u>RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE</u></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><p>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>You are <b>X</b>, your friend <b>O</b>. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.</p></li>
        <li><p>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</p></li>
      </ul>
      <h2><u>HOW CAN I WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE?</u></h2>
      <p>
        To beat the other player (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you
        need to do to win.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three <b>Xs</b> in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to
        stop the other player from getting three <b>Os</b> in a row.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you put an <b>X</b> in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next <b>X</b>? You look at the empty
        squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three <b>Xs</b> in a row.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also have to watch where the other player puts its <b>O</b>. That could change what you do next. If the other player gets two
        <b>Os</b> in a row, you have to put your next <b>X</b> in the last empty square in that row, or the other player will win. You are
        forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.
